  - get focusedEntity to actually smoothly follow
  - remove TURBINE from pheromoneWorker
  - pheromoneWorker appears to not update after reset in level editor


Game Engine Base Components:
  - all entities should be stored as objects
  - config **
    - entity config shouldn't live on the entity, instead access
      static properties from the registry
    - separate entity prototype with all the starting values
  - actions/animations
    - from timetravel ****
      - reducer, and queuing, cancelling, and performing actions
    - NEED a better system for spritesheet frames
      (perhaps go back to what antocracy uses)
  - level editor
     - re-render on arrowkeys when game is paused
  - loading levels
    - gotta be a better way, perhaps timetravel ***
  - sound
    - adapt SFX component from timetravel *
  - modals/splash screens
    - adapt from timetravel *
  - gameOverSystem
    - from timetravel **
